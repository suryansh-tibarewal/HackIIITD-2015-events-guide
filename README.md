## HackIIITD-2015-events-guide

A Delhi-centric Events-based Android application, which can act as a complete master control for an explorer. It provides the user with a list of events happening around him or her (all events, with some of them specially recommended for that user); a list of nearby places including restaurants, shopping centres, attractions, hotels, and their distance from the user's current location - basically a complete Tour Guide!
